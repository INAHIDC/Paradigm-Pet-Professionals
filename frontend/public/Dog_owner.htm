            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as there are well
                over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits
                between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the
                reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as reduced
                blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you
                care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise.
                In this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
                stages of their lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Diet & Exercise</h2>
            <p>Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies should be
                nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six
                months old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one
                year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is
                composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The ASPCA says just a 10 percent decrease in body
                water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch
                hydrated!</p>
            <p>Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as
                sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size
                differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine
                exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought
                of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged
                to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage
                physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful
                attention to toys that require supervision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Grooming & Handling</h2>
            <p>Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush frequently to
                reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
                difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded
                areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how
                strong-willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure
                the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as
                always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be
                cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the
                chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both
                your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Vaccinations & Medications</h2>
            <p>You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
                recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus.
                Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of
                these include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</p>
